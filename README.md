# Identifying the Problem 🚨

Stray animals of all species face numerous challenges, including:
- **Road Accidents**: Stray animals wandering on streets pose risks for drivers and themselves, often leading to accidents. 🚗🐕
- **Rabies and Disease Risk**: Stray animals can carry diseases like rabies, which can spread to humans. In India, stray animals contribute to the spread of rabies, leading to over **20,000 deaths** annually. 🦠
- **Public Safety**: Stray animals, whether they are dogs, cats, or larger animals, can pose a threat to public safety due to potential aggression or illness. 🚶‍♂️⚠️
- **Lack of Adoption Opportunities**: Many stray animals are left without homes, suffering in the streets due to limited adoption resources. 🏚️
