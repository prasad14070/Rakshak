## Introduction 🌟
**Rakshak** is a **simple, user-friendly app** that allows anyone to contribute to the welfare of stray animals, whether they're looking to adopt, vaccinate, feed, or provide temporary care. Rakshak connects animal lovers, volunteers, and organizations, creating a united front to improve the lives of stray animals. 

By providing a platform for adoption, vaccination, feeding, and fostering, we aim to create a world where **no stray animal is left behind** — from dogs and cats to birds, cows, and other animals.

## Identifying the Problem 🚨

Stray animals of all species face numerous challenges, including:
- **Lack of care**: Stray animals often lack access to food, water, or shelter, leaving them vulnerable to health issues, diseases, and injuries. 🐕🐈🦢
- **Rabies and Disease Risk**: Stray animals can carry diseases like rabies, which can spread to humans. In India, stray animals contribute to the spread of rabies, leading to over **20,000 deaths** annually. 🦠
- **Public Safety**: Stray animals, whether they are dogs, cats, or larger animals, can pose a threat to public safety due to potential aggression or illness. 🚶‍♂️⚠️
- **Lack of Adoption Opportunities**: Many stray animals are left without homes, suffering in the streets due to limited adoption resources. 🏚️

These issues highlight the need for effective solutions that improve the lives of all stray animals, ensure their health, and reduce their impact on public safety.
